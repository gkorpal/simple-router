We require that you first provide yes/no answers about the components you implemented and then provide details later.

**************** Yes/No Answers **************

1) The router can successfully route packets between the firewall and the application servers? 

Yes/No

2) The router correctly handles ARP requests and replies?

Yes/No

3) The router correctly handles traceroutes through it (where it is not the end host) and to it (where it is the end host)?

Yes/No

4) The router responds correctly to ICMP echo requests?

Yes/No

5) The router handles TCP/UDP packets sent to one of its interfaces. In this case the router should respond with an ICMP port unreachable?

Yes/No

6) The router maintains an ARP cache whose entries are invalidated after a timeout period (timeouts should be on the order of 15 seconds)?

Yes/No

7) The router queues all packets waiting for outstanding ARP replies. If a host does not respond to 5 ARP requests, the queued packet is dropped and an ICMP host unreachable message is sent back to the source of the queued packet?

Yes/No

8) The router does not needlessly drop packets (for example when waiting for an ARP reply)?

Yes/No

**************** Yes/No Answers (EXTRA CREDIT) **************

1) Does your code provide guaranteed timeouts? 

Yes/No

2) Can you drop and log all packets arriving to the external interface and destined to an internal interface in SE mode?

Yes/No

3) Can you supporting outbound two-way TCP traffic?

Yes/No

**************** Brief Answers **************

Briefly describe how you confirmed (tested) your
router had each of the *Required Functionalities*:

* The router can successfully route packets between the firewall and
  the application servers.


* The router correctly handles ARP requests and replies.


* The router correctly handles traceroutes through it (where it is not
  the end host) and to it (where it is the end host).


* The router responds correctly to ICMP echo requests.


* The router handles TCP/UDP packets sent to one of its interfaces. In
  this case the router should respond with an ICMP port unreachable.


* The router maintains an ARP cache whose entries are invalidated
  after a timeout period (timeouts should be on the order of 15
  seconds).


* The router queues all packets waiting for outstanding ARP
  replies. If a host does not respond to 5 ARP requests, the queued
  packet is dropped and an ICMP host unreachable message is sent back
  to the source of the queued packet.


* The router does not needlessly drop packets (for example when
  waiting for an ARP reply)


**************** Brief Answers (EXTRA CREDIT) **************

* Provide guaranteed timeouts


* Drop and log all packets arriving to the external interface and destined to an internal interface in SE mode


* Supporting outbound two-way TCP traffic
